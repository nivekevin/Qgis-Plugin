description =This QGis Python plugin extracts intersections and creates classes according to
	the number of intersected lines and their angularity
about= After extracting the intersections, 
	the corresponding line segments are divided up (every 10 meters by default) and 
		the average angularity as well as standard deviation is calculated.
	The classification according to averages has been manually set
		to correspond to common street intersections, from 3 to 5-way intersections.
	The classification according to standard deviation is binary :
		if SD<1, the angle is considered straight, otherwise it is considered curvy.
	The standard deviation classification is made according to
		the number of curvy /straight lines an intersection is composed of.
