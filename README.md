# Qgis-Plugin

This Hub has been created to help with the coding of a QGIS plugin, who's use will be to : recognise intersections in a mutistring geometry devide the multistring into strings with intersections as their endpoints make points out of said intersections in a different layer create a buffer of a given static or dynamic size, either a function of itself or a second criteria create points at the junction of the string and the buffer radius return orientation and relative angularity

This is only a fraction. This is my first try a Python / Qgis but I am confident in my learning abilities. As of 05/16, I have 4 months to complete this project. If anyone is reading this, I am always open to constructive critisism.
